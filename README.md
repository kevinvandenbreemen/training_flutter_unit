## Unit Testing
Unit and unit integration testing are among the most important parts of the development process, particularly among those wishing to practice TDD.  This project demonstrates techniques and strategies for unit testing the business logic behind a Flutter app.

### What About Mocking - Does Flutter Support That?
It certainly does.  You can check out an example of a simple controller that displays even numbers from data loaded from a service in the /test/integrationtest.dart file

For more on Mockito (Dart Style) you can check out https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mockito
